# Rust Black Jack

This is a little project I decided to play around with to get more familiar with rust. Some areas are still quite coupled, but I'm not to worried about super clean code.

## Running the project

- ## [Install Rust and Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html)

```bash
cargo run
```
